# fpga-de-lite10-vga-game
 A repository for a simple dodgeball game I made back in 2019 while practicing VHDL and Intel Quartus Prime to program the DElite-10 FPGA board.

The game features:
1) VGA driver to display the pixels
2) VGA element drivers to create game elements (text and symbols)
2) Internal ADC used to read joystick inputs

### Gameplay
The user simply selects the start option in the menu and controls a white ball using the joystick. The objective is to dodge from incoming red balls for as long as they can.
